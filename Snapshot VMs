#  Script is pretty self explanatory, it will snapshot a list of VMs in a given folder. 
#  Best practice is to make sure the VMs are powered off.  If a VM is on and not
#  running VMTools (i.e. PfSense, VOS, Security Onion, etc) it WILL NOT not snapshot.  
#  All VMs will have the same snapshot name (i.e. MySnapshotName).:

$VMFolder = Read-Host 'Enter folder name'

Write-Host "Creating Snapshot for:" $VMName
$VMName | New-Snapshot -Memory -Quiesce -Name "MySnapshotName" -RunAsync}

Write-Host "Completed!"
